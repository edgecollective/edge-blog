<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is anyone in engineering ed teaching slow growth/human-scale growth/“against exponential growth” models for technology? Would love to see a syllabus. My students hear anecdotal stories but need economic models in more sustained form.</p>&mdash; ablerism (@ablerism) <a href="https://twitter.com/ablerism/status/1334136306054598665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This timely and useful prompt by [@ablerism](https://twitter.com/ablerism) points to a devasting gap in current engineering pedagogy.

In the last few years, climate activism, especially among youth, has achieved an unprecedented urgency.  Critiques of our current economic system and its reliance on exponential growth are now commonplace; there are widespread calls for the fossil fuel industry to be dismantled immediately. 

But if we hope to inhabit a future without fossil fuels, and live within a flourishing economy that respects planetary boundaries, we must complement our critique with a positive, guiding vision and agenda.  We must collectively design alternative, sustainable approaches to food systems, water infrastrucutre, housing, energy, communications -- everything, at every scale. 

What follows is a hodge-podge collection of media, authors, and movements that seem to me to provide useful guidance or provocation.

> "By now, dystopia may have become a luxury genre. Indulging in miserable future scenarios is not something everyone has time for. William Gibson recently repurposed his own adage, “the future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed” to say that “dystopia is not very evenly distributed” either.2 For most, the dystopias the privileged entertain themselves with are old news. In the current political landscape, “when we are all living in the shadow of at least half a dozen wildly science fiction scenarios,” to quote Gibson again, and while Hollywood harps on every version of paranoia to construct a thousand dystopias according to formula, dwelling on dystopia could be seen as downright lazy.3 Along with the resources to sit around and ponder the future of humanity, shouldn’t there come the responsibility to invent actionable proposals as opposed to cautionary tales?"

> "It’s hard out here for futurists under 30.

> "As we percolated through our respective nations’ education systems, we were exposed to WorldChanging and TED talks, to artfully-designed green consumerism and sustainable development NGOs. Yet we also grew up with doomsday predictions slated to hit before our expected retirement ages, with the slow but inexorable militarization of metropolitan police departments, with the failure of the existing political order to deal with the existential-but-not-yet-urgent threat of climate change. Many of us feel it’s unethical to bring children into a world like ours. We have grown up under a shadow, and if we sometimes resemble fungus it should be taken as a credit to our adaptability.

> "The "solar" in Solarpunk is both a description and metaphor for the movement's commitment to a utopia that is accessible to every human on earth, as well as to all of our planet's lifeforms. No single business can capture and privatize sunlight to hoard it for itself or sell it at a cost. It's one of the only universally accessible goods. Solarpunk futures envision a world of distributed clean energy, available and benefiting everyone.

> "The re-distribution of power, whether it's political or electric, is at the heart of my story," Solarpunk author, Alia Gee, tells Hopes&Fears. 'Getting the power aspect taken care of is the only way I believe there can be a better future for everyone. (I'm very keen on the everyone part. Not just white males or CIS or human-like life forms.)'"

## Tim Jackson

Jackson, an economist, was commissioned by the UK government to write a report on the future of the British economy, which he expanded into a book. The book argues that the current global economy relies on exponential growth, that this is unsustainable in terms of material and energy resources, and that we must therefore seek 'non-growth' economic models.

## Four Futures

In 'Four Futures', Peter Frase assumes that the rise of automation will necessarily undermine capitalism, and lays out a 'quadrant' analysis of possible post-capitalist futures that might result. The two axes are "authoritarian vs. non-authoritarian" and "scarcity vs. abundance". Of particular note are two quadrants: "non-authoritarian + abundance" -- the 'Star Trek' future, in which everyone can meet their needs in decentralized manner; and "authoritarian + abundance" -- the 'Anti- Star Trek' future, in which high technology is under centralized, corporate governance.
