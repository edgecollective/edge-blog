digital colonialism is a good place to start for these folks
can you then expand political economy to include covid
then bring back down to EC theory?

What is the point of science?
What is science?
Best definition I've heard: it's doing your damndest with your mind to figure things out.
It's not: what professors do.  It's not what academics do.  There's no uniform method, despite what even some scientists say.
"Listen to the science" -- means listen to a highly systematic, reasonable approach to things. 

So why do we do it?
Some people find it fun.  Some people find it beautiful.  Many find it useful.  
Because you want a job doing something useful for society?
Because you want to do something good in the world?
You could've gone into business or something else.

so i think a lot of you come into this saying something like, i want a job that's well-paid, that's also interesting, where i do something good, or cool, or both.
