## Floodsense

[flood-sense](https://github.com/edgecollective/flood-sense)

Note:  the RadioHead library doesn't work with the M4 / samd51, so the only options for the M4 are Circuitpython or the LoRa gateway (lmic) code.  Since NOLA Flotilla only has the M4, we have to go with CircuitPython for now.

### Valedalama

Calculated that we're generating about 5 KB per day of data in local sqlite storage when capturing data from one sensor at 15 min intervals.  That means that a 16 GB USB drive can store about 8K years of data; so no worries there.

TODO -- find a nice enclosure 

## CSA / pandemic readings

- [Small local farmers aren't the solution to the crisis](https://twitter.com/Casein_Micelles/status/1259826227285766145?s=19) -- argues for regional. 

- [Farming vs carrying capacity](https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/1259657547012640770?s=20). 

Aside: interesting to think of where solarpunk sits on the ecosocialist / ecomodernist spectrum (if it's a spectrum). And to pose this as a question to folks.

Aside:  approach the EC Podcast as a 'CSA' in the same sense that Raj talked about it -- not sure of monthly content, but subscriptions help smooth over risk for the producer.
