# Misc notes

## Overview

- Some other edge collective projects.

## Why ventilation and filtration?

- COVID is airborne.
- So are a bunch of other diseases.
- Our infrastructure is 'behind the times'
- Our intuition is often wrong about airborne disease.
- Show how cigarette smoke is the right idea.
- There are a few ways to address this. 
- Mask (lego people mask)
- Distance (can help, but isn't perfect -- show graph).
- Improve indoor ventilation via HVAC (if recirculation, then filtration).
- Improve indoor ventilation via windows and doors.
- Clean the air inside the room. 

To some extent, we just want to reduce risk as much as possible. Hard to quantify / know the 'absolute risk'.

Often, folks are masked, distancing.  Opening windows might not be allowed, or might not improve much.  HVAC isn't within their control.  So: indoor filtration systems.  

The Corsi design is low-cost. It's been vetted fairly well now.  It's better vetted than many of the commercial designs out there.  It's built from known materials. We can tweak it, improve it. It's high bang-for-buck.  So, let's build some.  We can estimate how much they'll help indoors, in terms of ACH.

## Why ventilation and filtration?

## Basic background on indoor ventilation

- HVAC system
- far-field transmission
- near-field transmission (distancing)
- vents, windows, doors
- filtration / purifiers
- buying devices that don't always work
- not always able to open windows or doors
- ACH

So: we want to know:
1. how bad it is
2. how to improve it as much as possible

## But: initial interventions
- Mask. Distance.
- Increase ventilation as much as possible.
- Ideally: outside, if you're worried. Especially when unmasked for lunch.
- This still leaves a lot of people indoors.

## Standard metric for ventilation: ACH
- mass balance, contaminants
- how long it takes to remove X% of contaminants in room

## Ways to assess ventilation 
- If you can ...
- Good to know if school knows already.
- CO2 tracer gas method is pretty effective (with caveats). 
- More involved methods described in HSP's doc. 
- Will say more about how we're trying to make tracer method easier with open software and hardware. 

## Install filtration
- We can estimate how impactful in terms of eACH.
- Might as well boost to max you can afford / stand / practical.
- Then if you find #s are low, or ventilation is great, can back off.

## Corsi-Rosenthal Box 

- Placing filters on fan is old idea. Issue: strain on fan, reduced air flow.
- Corsi suggestion: build a 'box' made of filter materials.  Increased surface area means increased flow, reduced strain on fan, more air filtered, more effective. 
- Suggestion is that MERV-13 is fairly optimal; MERV-11 also effective. 
- Rosenthal built, evaluated, added some tweaks.

## Box Design
- Fan on top
- Filters on sides 
- Can also add to bottom, with little stilts.
- Best to point air flow up re: circulation in room.
- Best to place away from walls.
- Avoid leaks.
- Shroud.

## Shroud
- Reverse air flow at edges
- Block with tape or cardboard.

## Corsi Box effectiveness
- Typical metric is 'CADR' in cubic feet per minute. 
- I.e. -- how much air is cleaned per minute.
- If you know the volume of the room, and efficiency of filters, you can then estimate an equivalent air changes per hours.
- Efficiency of filters -- not virus size, but size of particles on which virus tends to hitch a ride. Some debate on proper number. Can be conservative for now.
- Example calculation. How it boosts your ACH.

## STEM ideas
- visualization of aerosols
- energy expenditure / units / metrics
- HVAC systems -- mapping out, alternatives
- air flow -- anemometer
- monitoring -- electronics, measurement
- exponential fitting / modeling
- risk modeling
