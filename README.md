# edge-blog 

Uses [eleventy.js](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate a static blog site. Markdown files and images are compiled into html using templates and CSS, and a ready-serve website is placed in the '_site' folder. 

## install

npm install

(missing a css module I think; need to add that to package.json I think?)

## compile and serve up page

./serve.sh

## deploy online

./deploy.sh
