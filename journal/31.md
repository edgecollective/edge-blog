blurb: How to engage people regarding collapse  
---

I find myself continuously beginning by trying to describe the difficulty of our position, the constraints.  The initial observations that are leading me to concern.  But what happens is that my interlocutor considers me a 'doomer', and shuts down.  They think: this is a movie where we need to find a way to survive, and I'm giving up;  they want to maintain hope.

But the better analogy is:  this is the movie where the initial plan has turned out to be folly, and the only way to save ourselves is to set on a different course.  It's a different dynamic:  it is the clear-sighted, seeing the iceberg, and trying to shift course before disaster.  It is a critique of hubris. The other film is instead a critique of despair, or nihilism.
