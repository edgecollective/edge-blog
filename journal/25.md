Greer's ideas of stages

That they might also be parallel

Polycrisis

Making friends

Narrow tech, wide tech

Inviting tech

Much of the challenge in the past was:  the lesson learned before was humility, stay in your lane, make some small, good contribution that contributes to the edifice

# Project ideas

Biochar

Ham Radio -- JS8Call, APRS, LoRA, SDR, making small radios

Bike trailers, all sorts

Compressed air

Outdoor stuff

Nomadic stuff
