### Greenhouse sensors

How long a cable can we use on the ds18b20?

[nice discussion here](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/ds18b20-length-of-wires-limitation/496404/6)

[https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/guidelines-for-reliable-long-line-1wire-networks.html](https://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/guidelines-for-reliable-long-line-1wire-networks.html)

Suggestion:

Use CAT-5 cable twisted pair. Ground any unused wires. Should be able to get approx 100' distance without trouble.

### Sensor drying technniques

Testing a 'soil moisture' probe technique for the tomato plant, too?

Purchase an Acclima sensor for soil moisture?

> The performance of five types of commercially available soil moisture sensors was evaluated at two fields with significantly different salinity levels and clay contents. The sensors included TDR315, CS655, GS1, SM100, and CropX. The accuracy of each sensor was determined by comparing its readings with gravimetric measurements of soil water content obtained at several times during the study period. In general, all sensors responded to wetting and drying events. The TDR315, CS655, and GS1 sensors had acceptable accuracies for managing irrigations at the site with low salinity and low clay content (LSLC) based on root mean square error (RMSE). However, none of the sensors performed satisfactorily at the site with high salinity and high clay content (HSHC), with RMSE estimates that were up to eight times larger compared to the values at LSLC. In addition, high levels of noise were observed in TDR315 due to high salinity and out-of-range responses and consequently missing readings in case of CS655 sensor. A potential solution for using soil moisture sensors in irrigation scheduling under such conditions is the use of site-specific calibrations.
