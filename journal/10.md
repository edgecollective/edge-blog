Summary of recent readings.  

There aren't sufficient material (esp mineral, but also likely oil and gas) resources in order to achieve a renewable transition to the economy as it currently stands.  

Oil is being consumed as oil-based infrastructure is being used as if it were never going to run out. Indications are that the quality of oil is decreasing.  Our ability to source cheap diesel may be diminishing soon.  Coal is used in the production and deployement of renewable energy infrstructure, and there is currently no replacement.  Much of our infrastructure would need to be replaced if we were to switch to renewables. This takes energy and time.  For many vital applications, there is no known viable non-fossil replacement; theoretical subtitutions exist in some cases, but they haven't been shown to scale, and even if they were adopted wholesale right now, they would take years (a decade or more?) to deploy.      

Many of the elements of the current plans that would allow us to remain at or below 1.5C or 2C are not based on realistic numbers in terms of minerals or available technologies.   

It seems likely that the future will involve significant disruption to the economy and/or the climate.  If fossil fuels become expensive, many things will need to shift. Everything will become more localized, out of necessity, because transport will no longer be cheap.

One of the benefits of this form of low-carbon economy is increased agency. The systems of production, distrubution, will be under more local control -- the supply chains will be shorter, more legible.  The technologies will become less complex to produce (at least initially).  Imagine a world in which we feel more agency and involvement in the production of our lives and our tools.

The overlap with pedagogy is significant. Much of pedagogy is about increasing energy and capacity, our future will require this of us anwyay. The ideal pedagogy for children and adults won't differ so greatly when preparing for this future.

One way to begin to prototype this future right now, while networking across regions, is to focus on communications and navigation infrastructure.  GPS may go away; cellular networks and the internet may become unreliable.  Communication and navigation without these systems will rely on more 'analog' technologies.  Finding ways of bridging this transition might be involve 'hybrid' approaches that use the best available systems but 'fail gracefully' when they are not available.  I.e. we wouldn't choose to be out of touch with friends across the world now, because we might not easily be able to chat with them in the future.  Instead, we'll chat with them now, but make a plan for how to be in touch if the phone line fails.
