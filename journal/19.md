# Myofunctional questions

- palate expansion -- mechanics of that
- Bolton standards / template
- tongue release process
- timeline / urgency

# Projects up north

- Washington Academy
- East Macchias High
- arduino and biochar
- analysis / water testing / local engagement
- build a 2000 liter per day system
- start doing some workshops at Smithereen about biochar & water anyway

Kearns on biochar gasifier: [https://vimeo.com/38501679](https://vimeo.com/38501679)

- gasifier charcoal more effective at filtering water than kiln charcoals

Benefits of gasifier:

- more complete production
- relatively low emissions
- use the fuel as the charcoal source
- no need for external energy source 

design of gasifier:  Top-lit up-draft -- TLUD --

Bamboo char is a good option

Size of fuel is important -- too fine, will block holes

Difference in mass in and mass out is a good indicator of sufficient processing -- 85% mass loss is a good target

750 to 950 celcius range is good for water filtration biochar

> Other than minimizing and monitoring chlorine and humic acid concentrations, there is essentially no foreseeable way of removing THMs at the water treatment plant. Water system engineers want there to be a chlorine residual (often referred to as “the residual”) in your distribution pipes because this keeps your water safe from potentially harmful bacteria and viruses as it travels through the distribution system to your home. 

> Unfortunately, it is this excess chlorine that reacts with organic matter present in your pipes to create THMs. Ultimately, this decision to chlorinate versus have no THMs is a tradeoff between safety from microbes and safety from THMs.

> Because there are so many different treatment products on the market, it is difficult to give a blanket statement about removal of THMs with home treatment products. In general, the easiest way to reduce THM’s in your tap water is to consider buying a National Science Foundation certified carbon filter for your drinking water at home; ensure that it is certified specifically under the NSF/ANSI Standard 53 Certification for THMs. Point-of-entry systems are recommended in order to protect you both from ingesting THMs as well as inhaling them, for example while doing the dishes or showering.
