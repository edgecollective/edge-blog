## Modernity

[https://twitter.com/csmaje/status/1685665447704715264?s=20](https://twitter.com/csmaje/status/1685665447704715264?s=20)

Smaje:

> Capitalism & socialism are often contrasted, but their shared modernist political grounding creates numerous overlaps. One of them is a tendency to think that human social organisation can master the vicissitudes of human & biophysical history 23/27

> I find civic republicanism & other traditions more plausible. They’re not about quiescently waiting for ‘disaster’, but they’re able to build negative or disastrous contingency into their political account 24/27

> I agree with the likes of McCarraher & Hine - capitalism is more of a surface problem, modernity itself being a deeper underlying one. Hence I find ecosocialist correctives to capitalist resource dynamics inadequate. There's a deeper cultural & spiritual problem to address 25/27

Laocoon:

> Can you recapitulate the definition of modernity at work here? 

Smaje:

> Roughly, ideas like a break with past history into true knowledge, an unfolding dynamic of human progress driven by social forces (markets, utility, class struggle), an emphasis on the material & practical & on instrumental control as the motor of progress, mass organisation etc

My own elaboration of that last point:

'Mass organization' might include the idea that the solution to most human problems is to build some large organizational structure or institution; or to try to steer the behavior of existing such organizations through mass protest.

This diagnosis seems right: capitalism as surface problem, modernity as the underlying, deeper problem. 

How, though, to begin to tackle or unravel modernism?

Short sketch of a response:  

- pedagogy, children and adults mixed. Focus on arts and crafts, simple hand tools. Anti-modernist Romanticism can be well-disguised and made more palatable to modernists in this form.
- hospitality towards strangers, gift giving / gift economy.  
- simple art, music, food sharing 
- outdoor adventure in small groups
