## Modernity

[https://twitter.com/csmaje/status/1685665447704715264?s=20](https://twitter.com/csmaje/status/1685665447704715264?s=20)

Smaje:

> Capitalism & socialism are often contrasted, but their shared modernist political grounding creates numerous overlaps. One of them is a tendency to think that human social organisation can master the vicissitudes of human & biophysical history 23/27

> I find civic republicanism & other traditions more plausible. They’re not about quiescently waiting for ‘disaster’, but they’re able to build negative or disastrous contingency into their political account 24/27

> I agree with the likes of McCarraher & Hine - capitalism is more of a surface problem, modernity itself being a deeper underlying one. Hence I find ecosocialist correctives to capitalist resource dynamics inadequate. There's a deeper cultural & spiritual problem to address 25/27

Laocoon:

> Can you recapitulate the definition of modernity at work here? 

Smaje:

> Roughly, ideas like a break with past history into true knowledge, an unfolding dynamic of human progress driven by social forces (markets, utility, class struggle), an emphasis on the material & practical & on instrumental control as the motor of progress, mass organisation etc

My own elaboration of that last point:

'Mass organization' might include the idea that the solution to most human problems is to build some large organizational structure or institution; or to try to steer the behavior of existing such organizations through mass protest.

This diagnosis seems right: capitalism as surface problem, modernity as the underlying, deeper problem. 

How, though, to begin to tackle or unravel modernism?

Short sketch of a response:  

- pedagogy, children and adults mixed. Focus on arts and crafts, simple hand tools. Anti-modernist Romanticism can be well-disguised and made more palatable to modernists in this form.
- hospitality towards strangers, gift giving / gift economy.  
- simple art, music, food sharing 
- outdoor adventure in small groups

## Notes re: discussion w/ J & M

Security:
- [truthout article](https://truthout.org/audio/abolition-means-reclaiming-the-commons-and-rejecting-securitization/)
- [anti-security manifesto](/img/journal/Anti_security_A_Declaration.pdf)

Sovereignty:
- [sovereign citizen movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement)

Projects:
- community tool sharing
- building cold frames
- estimating calories one can produce from X amount of veggies / eggs / etc -- i.e. how much food is required to feed X people
- bicycle repair and bike cargo trailers
- animal power
- ham radio
- electromechanical salvage
- rainwater harvesting
- surveying urban, surburban, rural lands (including those currently owned by private individuals) for food production potential
- developing rituals of community togetherness, mutual aid, hospitality towards strangers

Sweet-p:

nice reference for making low-leakage voltage divider for circuit: [https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/battery-monitoring-voltage-divider/](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/battery-monitoring-voltage-divider/)

suggests using high value resistors, with cap across 'lower' resistor on the voltage divider

also interesting that measuring voltage for li-on can be useful for assessing battery life; but for most other chemistries, not as much, because not as linear

> Use a high-value resistor in the voltage divider circuit and put a capacitor in parallel with the low-side resistor.

> For li-ion (except LFP), voltage measurement tends to be good enough, because the curve has a large span, and it's almost linear from about 100% to 10%: 4.2V-3.2V is 27% of the nominal voltage, a massive difference between full and empty!

> For all other battery types, voltage measurement is almost useless, unless combined with a lot of other information.

Notes on updates to board:
- need to increase spacing on footprint for MCP17X0 lin reg
- need to add cap in parallel with 'low' side of battery voltage divider

Field school ideas:

no-weld bike trailer. various designs. experiments. document them. co-design them with folks.  they can build the 'classic' kit or make modifications.  different uses / tweaks.  longer and shorter versions.  version for carrying kayak, another bike, a small bike plus toddler, etc.  

worries re: liability ... ?

How to reach out to like-minded folks. 

A good description of the core idea, mission.  The narrative.

What one is trying to do. 

First attempts:

It's hard to know how to prepare for the future.  Relocalization of the economy, choosing technologies that are more resilient and locally-produced, developing close connections with neighbors, developing some autonomy and learning how to produce the things we need -- these seem like things which, even if they prove 'unnecessary', are good projects, anyway, especially for youth.

So, a focus on pedagogy.  Training this next generation to be generalists, curious, able to tackle whatever comes.  They need to be able to grok the present level of technology -- especially the ubiquitous tech, what's likely to stay around, what's been mass-produced (for salvage) -- and also develop an affinity for the 'old tech', the pre-fossil-fuel approaches.  They need to be students of supply chains. There is a huge amount to learn from the Global South -- folks where the 'future' has already hit.  Looking for precedents.

The perspective 'low-tech magazine' is a great one -- including his research methods and approach. 

There is a wide array of things to do, here;  so, pick the highest-leverage, most-enjoyable ones.

E.g.:  
- radio communication
- mapping
- water capture, testing, filtering
- food growing
- transport via bike / renewables     
- boating
