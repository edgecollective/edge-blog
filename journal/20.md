# Design within bounds

It's like fighing for and being granted sovereignty over a sinking island.

Monbiot's figure.

Not 'what would be nice in the realm of the extreme possible', but best outcome given the probabilities.

The analogy many have in their head is of the losing team, or the mother trying to save her child in a warzone.  The 'never give up' mentality.  The struggle against nihilism, against apathy, against doomerism.  In these contexts, the reasoning goes, we must choose to be optimistic. We must rage against the dying of the light.  

But in this case, it's more that we're on a sinking ship, and we can keep it afloat if we abandon the rear dance deck, but folks who are in love with dancing are saying 'I'm sure we'll figure something out.' 

Or: we've invested our savings on a world tour; the weather report is horrible; we could have a fun trip if we canceled our plans and had a picnic at home instead;  but we press on with the tour.

---

Our ideology should not be divorced from a material analysis of the likely state of the world, or else it is a dangerous ideology.

We are telling people to put their energy into a plan that claims 'there's no reason to think that we might not find an oasis over those hills', when we are about to run out of water, and have the option to use our dance tent to capture rainwater locally.  

The real work is not how to desperately find a way to maintain our current standard of living, but how to reorganize ourselves so that the way we live is within current bounds.  THEN we can play.  

A primary focus would not be on small hacks to big ag, or ways of making small scale farming financially sustainable.  The focus should be on developing the life support systems that we'll need: growing food to feed the growers, and then others, in an expanding circle outward from that land.

The appropriate technology movement and the transition movement weren't uniformly concerned with material depletion;  there is a strong understanding about the removal of oil from the system, but perhaps not a full understanding of the implications for plastic, steel, fertilizer, cement.  

The Greer idea -- that we should anticipate a period in which we are still surrounded by recent material abundance, but the supply chains have stopped -- is more in line with what we have in store.

So the 'hack' in FarmHack might be:

- hacking farming as it's currently envisioned.  Using resources within it to consider how to do small, self-provisioning farming, and build out from there. 
- scavenging and adapting and surfing the 'downshift', preparing and implementing a lower-energy future.

--

If the lower-energy future comes about, we'd best start preparing now.

If we're somehow saved from it due to some unforeseen energy source miracle, we'll still need to conserve materials, lower our footprint because of other planetary boundaries.  The lower energy we become now, the less climate damage we'll incur.

And lastly: if we're depending on energy and material systems outside our control, then there's a fundamental ceiling to our sovereignty.  

---

FarmHack had its moment as a recognition of information sharing online, blogs, wikis, and this philosophy applied to farming.  Information will set you free.  An era of abundance, if we would just adopt the proper ideological framing.  

Now we see that we are in an era of limits.  Of abundance, but it requires a different framing:  we need to make do with lower energy, lower material throughput.  Increased conviviality, but within bounds.  If we're not aware of the bounds, we're lost. The bounds become very important.

## CO2-Slim notes

Trying to develop a systems approach. 

Energy.  Water.  Communications.

Biochar for water filtration.

Communications -- what sort of radio system, what coordination, what protocols.

Clothing.

Building shelters.

Making lumber.

Wind power.

Compressed air.

Setting up systems with idea that they'll last 50 or more years.

Refridgeration.

Dehydration.

Desalination.

How many calories can be produced on what area of land.

The class distinctions around who is getting into farming

We're all going to need to become peasants

Energy is going to need to become relocalized

So it's a 'grassroots-led' but we have to become the grassroots

The current hangups with folks in the North, the things they want to hold onto 
 
Finding ways of making it less about belt-tightening and more about festival

Leading with festival -- this is one takeaway from the gathering in Maine

pizza as practice
