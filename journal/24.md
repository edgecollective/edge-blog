## Working on projects whose outcome might be generations hence

It's hard for most of us to imagine engaging in a project whose ultimate outcome we're unlikely ever to witness. Some of the projects that 'collapse-aware' folks might take on fall in this category.  We might struggle in the next decades to minimize the impacts of climate change and try to avert various disasters;  some bad things may nevertheless happen (some bad climate things seem likely to happen) within our lifetimes that won't be 'undone' or well adapted-to for generations.

One wonders, though, whether this 'near future' focus is a somewhat historically peculiar feature of our times. Today, the technological substrate upon which we rely and within which we live seems to change significantly across generations, and even within generations; but 200 years ago, the basic shape and feel of a life was likely much more stable across generations.

Many projects undertaken by people long ago were accomplished on a multi-generational scale.  Cathedrals, aqueducts, and other large infrastructure are obvious examples; the multi-generational development of family farms, and the nomadic journeys of communities aware of their own historical trajectories, are more common and perhaps less-obvious examples.
