Need to set up cut list for the magic garden fence.

Idea re: romanticism -- what can we glean from it that is useful today?  What inspiring readings / biographies might we share?  

Re: FarmHack -- what is the angle I'd like to promote there?  

It's time to start writing something along the lines of permaculture, but reinvigorated.  Something proper to our time.  

Meanwhile:  the goal should be to have a mobile workshop to the extent possible, to engage the community where it is, if one can't yet find the ideal community locally.  

Start with a utility trailer and scale up.  The car and the trailer, combined, have a lot of storage.  We have artisan's, and can try to find other workshop space locally. 

Bike trailers and etc will also be useful.

Need to plan carefully around storage, and cull ruthlessly.
