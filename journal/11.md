blurb: Project and networking ideas.

# Navigation / maps / communication

Overall, the biggest leverage is in networking.  Finding other people and projects with which to connect.  Ventilation and air quality are important aspects of being in the world during a pandemic; but they're not the most exciting rallying focus.

The main topics that seem 'fun' and useful from a networking standpoint:

- offline mapping and navigation, with GPS assist when possible, using compasses, special maps, hybrid coordinate systems
- alternative / backup communications systems
- heating and food preservation
- what materials might be processed / salvaged / used locally from a minerals standpoint
- low carbon logistics / sail freight

Even simply connecting with the folks associated with low-carbon logistics and sail freight, as well as the folks in Maine around farming, would be a great start.
