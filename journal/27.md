Note how difficult it is even to find a way to think clearly now.  I wonder if the phone will ring.  I try to write in google docs, and notifications pop up via unanticipated channels.

It won't always be this way. 

Eventually things will settle down into a very different form of life.

The next decades, however, will be the tumultuous transition.

There will be a period of chaotic shift -- a sort of musical chairs, as peoples resettle, resources are fought over.  Cultural values might shift due to scarcity. 

But what became clear to me yesterday was that, no matter what, life can still be beautiful.  And that we may be living in a particularly meaningful time. 

There is the task of ensuring a good life for oneself, one's family, one's friends ..

It also seems important to find ways of connecting that don't require a 'gift' or a 'shared project'. 

And not to think that entire systems need to be mounted in order to explore certain aspects.

There's an overall sketch, and one can start to connect the dots.

The biochar project has resonance in many different contexts -- locally and abroad. 

The bike trailer is an easy way to talk to folks.

The farm cart is a nice legible project for working with farmers.

Imagine setting up a ham radio station and beginning to connect to emergency volunteer services.
