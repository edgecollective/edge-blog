Review comparing Acclima to another probe: [https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/vzj2.20013](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/vzj2.20013)

Upshot: when soil is non-uniform, need to do careful calibration. Optimistic view: if you place some targeted sensors in particular locations, and develop some experience, you might be able to establish a local intuition around what the sensors are telling you ...
