# Indoor Ventilation Assessment and Improvement

## Overview 

### Summary points

(Updated: 2021-07-23 12:37:54 )

- COVID-19 is now known to be 'airborne', which has implications for how it is transmitted, and how to mitigate the risk of contracting it. 
- The intuition we should now have for our viral exposure is more akin to e.g. inhaling cigarette smoke than to droplets from e.g. a spray bottle
- A relatively air-tight room can therefore pose a significant transmission risk, even if the infected person is located on the other side of the room.
- Most masks are more effective at preventing the wearer from sending particles into the room than at preventing viral particles from being inhaled by the wearer.
- As of June 22 2021, it appears likely that those fully vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine who experience breakthrough infections may likely transmit the disease to others.  
- Hospitals aim for a minimum of 6-12 ACH, with studies showing improvements up to 20 ACH (but not really beyond that).

Main twitter thread on ACH: [https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1366055136859070468?s=20](https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1366055136859070468?s=20)

- need to account for other sources of indoor CO2

- snapshot CO2 measurements don't help you predict impact of additional occupants on concentration, and thus make it hard to know how safe a space is

- Havard School of Public Health suggests at least 5 or 6 air changes per hour

- Recommends getting CO2 level up to 1000 ppm to 1500 ppm

- Can get sense of variation in fit by fitting slightly different regions.  Don't report more than one decimal place.

- ACH can change by factor of 5-10 depending on indoor-outdoor temp difference, windspeed (at least at low ach) [https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1366055181578694657/photo/1](https://twitter.com/Poppendieck/status/1366055181578694657/photo/1)

- Having neighboring connected rooms empty tends to overestimate the ACH; having neighboring connected rooms occupied will tend to underestimate the ACH.

- HVAC can mix rooms with other rooms, adding complication.

- CO2 monitors need to be calibrated frequently to avoid drift in absolute measurements; but relative measurements tend to be solid.

- need to acknowledge additional sources of CO2.

### Menzies et al 1995

Uses precisely the method. Compares windows / doors condition.

Findings:

- use a fan during release of co2 to homogenize measurements throughout room; don't need to do afterward.

> Good mixing of the tracer gas is important to ensure that the
decline in concentration reflects dilution from air exchange and
not simply continued mixing within the room. Evidence of good
mixing was provided by minimal variation between different sites
in the same room in the preliminary study, linear decay of the
log-transformed concentration of CO 2 (log data not shown), and
by reproducibility of repeated measures of air-change rate. All
of these conditions were met when a large fan was operated dur-
ing the release, meaning that this aspect of the protocol was es-
sential to achieve accurate reproducible estimates of air-change
rates. (p 1999)

- They reference the impact of having a practitioner in the room while monitoring decay. Need to review this. Good reason to have data collection remote.

- One of their fitting methods stops within 2 SD of baseline.

### Huang et al 

They do a CO2 experiment with baking soda and etc in dental offices.

One big impact is that they show that this method compares favorably with calculating ACH using CFM assessment at vents.

Stir mixture for 2 minutes, then remove from room. 

Small oscillating fan was used to keep CO2 well-mixed in room.

They use a simpler method for determing the decay -- 'the time needed to remove 63% of excess CO2'.  Method described bottom p 11 top of p 12.

They indicate that the CO2 method is a better measurement than CFM ventilation rate (p 12).

### Roulet et al 

Nice presentaiton of the log fit method

### Escombe / tropical medicine presentation

[https://www.ghdonline.org/uploads/Measuring_Air_Changes.pdf](https://www.ghdonline.org/uploads/Measuring_Air_Changes.pdf)

They use a graph indicating the difference between windows opened and windows closed.

They use fire extinguishers to generate enough CO2.

They also use fans to guarantee mixing.

Can also use jackets.

They stop within 200 ppm of baseline. 

p 8 and 9 are key:  it's not just relative ACH, it's absolute ventilation that is the key determinent of risk. 

### Rhode Island Covid air filtration

[https://covid.ri.gov/covid-19-prevention/indoor-air-circulation](https://covid.ri.gov/covid-19-prevention/indoor-air-circulation)

> Ventilation with recirculated air will not reduce the risk of COVID-19 unless that recirculated air goes through a filter that is made to get rid of tiny particles. A filter’s Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values (MERV) rating describes how well it removes different sized particles in the air. A MERV rating of 13 or higher (MERV 13+) means that the filter gets rid of at least 90% of the particles the size of virus-containing aerosols. High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters are designed to exceed the highest MERV rating. A HEPA filter gets rid of at least 99.97% of particles that are even smaller than aerosols.

They recommend at 6+ ACH.

> "From the beginning of the pandemic, in the United States, there were six to eight of us trying to get the message out that this looks airborne to us," said Dr. Richard Corsi.

> "It's not just close contact and it's not just contaminated surfaces," Corsi explained. "It's also what I call 'far field' contact, which is if you're not standing 3 or 6 feet from a person but you happen to be in the same crowded restaurant or the same crowded bar or a classroom and you're not near the infector ... you can inhale aerosols, droplet nuclei that contain infectious viruses in them."

> That's because when someone who is infected coughs or even simply talks, tiny respiratory droplets are emitted into the air. If the space is not well-ventilated those particles can build.

> "The levels just keep accumulating and accumulating and accumulating to higher and higher levels in that indoor space," Corsi said.

> The scientists are calling for WHO to revise its recommendations and warn that these aerosols can potentially infect people so they can take the necessary steps to protect themselves and others.

> "We need to ventilate more, we need to use better filtration systems, we need to use ultraviolet radiation in some cases, we should be using portable air purifiers in some cases," Corsi said.

> Corsi also says we should all be wearing face coverings, and establishments should be limiting the number of people allowed inside at any given time.

### Lancet article in support of aerosol spread

[https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00869-2/fulltext)

> If an infectious virus spreads predominantly through large respiratory droplets that fall quickly, the key control measures are reducing direct contact, cleaning surfaces, physical barriers, physical distancing, use of masks within droplet distance, respiratory hygiene, and wearing high-grade protection only for so-called aerosol-generating health-care procedures. Such policies need not distinguish between indoors and outdoors, since a gravity-driven mechanism for transmission would be similar for both settings. But if an infectious virus is mainly airborne, an individual could potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, sneezes, or coughs. Reducing airborne transmission of virus requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols, including ventilation, air filtration, reducing crowding and time spent indoors, use of masks whenever indoors, attention to mask quality and fit, and higher-grade protection for health-care staff and front-line workers.2 Airborne transmission of respiratory viruses is difficult to demonstrate directly.3 Mixed findings from studies that seek to detect viable pathogen in air are therefore insufficient grounds for concluding that a pathogen is not airborne if the totality of scientific evidence indicates otherwise. Decades of painstaking research, which did not include capturing live pathogens in the air, showed that diseases once considered to be spread by droplets are airborne.4 Ten streams of evidence collectively support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted primarily by the airborne route.5



### Recommended ACH in hospitals / health care facilities

> Overall, the team found that 20 ACH had statistically significantly fewer particles and CFUs than 15 ACH. However, for the most part, 25 ACH did not provide significantly cleaner air than 20 ACH. For particles, one OR showed no statistical difference among 15, 20 or 25 ACH at all particle sizes, while another OR showed significantly cleaner air at 20 than at either 15 or 25. There was an isolated case with the more dispersed diffusers in which 25 ACH produced more particles than lower ventilation rates. The team could not confirm the cause of this phenomenon, but have seen other research indicating that higher ventilation rates can cause or “stir up” more airborne particles.

## Using CO2 to assess indoor ventilation

### Why is CO2 Monitoring Useful?

CO2 monitoring has long been used for determining the effectiveness of indoor residential ventilation. Changes in indoor CO2 concentration can indicate whether air inside a room has 'refreshed' since its most recent occupants left, or whether there is sufficient space and/or ventilation inside a building that people are unlikely to spread airborne illness. 

### Indoor CO2 PPM and COVID-19 transmission

Recently, [researchers](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.09.20191676v1.full.pdf) have been exploring CO2 monitoring as factor in the assessment of the relative risk of indoor transmission of [COVID-19](). In the case of airborne illness, there are a few very common questions that CO2 monitoring can help answer:

- How long should people wait for air in a space occupied by another 'pod' to 'turn over' before entering it? 
- How many people can occupy the same indoor space before it is too 'crowded'?
- What techniques (opening a window, modifying the ventilation system) are most effective at refreshing air within a space?  How much ventilation is needed (how many windows need to be opened) in a given space?

By monitoring CO2 levels in a space over the course of a few days, it may be possible to determine patterns that can effectively inform daily practices without requiring futher ongoing CO2 monitoring.  E.g., it may be determined that opening a single window in a room is enough to keep the indoor CO2 PPM at 'fresh air' levels even when fully occupied.  

### DIY CO2 Monitoring

Ongoing notes on development of a free-and-open-source CO2 monitor are posted [here](https://edgecollective.io/posts/notes/co2/).


### Misc

Need to figure out impact of having different sized holes on co2 apparatus.

- Presentation / tropical medicine / effect of room size?

- Recommended ACH for COVID / H-SPH?

- Find space where can measure air flow at vents to test ACH determination method?

- We saw that propane and indoor heating were complications at artisan'
