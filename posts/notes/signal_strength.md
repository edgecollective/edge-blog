blurb: Collecting tools for estimating line-of-sight locations based on topography.

Collecting some tools I'm finding for estimating line-of-sight locations based on topography. Will annotate further as I learn more.

## Ubiquiti AirLink Signal Strength Mapping Tool

The [AirLink tool](https://link.ui.com/#) looks really promising!  Its calculations are tailored towards Ubiquiti products; but it will display the height profile and a visualization of the Fresnel zone between any two given points -- which might be really useful for estimating radio signal strength in general for radios (like LoRa) that are heavily dependent on line-of-sight connections.
