Nice discussion on envirodiy [here](https://www.envirodiy.org/ultrasonic-water-depth-sensor/) of a Maxtobox-based design.

Another nice post on environdiy on evaluating their performance, [here](https://www.envirodiy.org/evaluation-water-level-monitoring-maxbotix-ultrasonic-sensors/).

- A question I have, here:  they consider the Onset logger to be the 'reference' ... but oughtn't we also to evalue *its* values?  I like the idea of conductive screws as an 'absolute' external check on either sensor (though maybe that measurement mode is more complex than I realize).
