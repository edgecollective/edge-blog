Points claimed in video:

- these designs are not subject to typical 'composting toilet' regulations; the composting does not occur in the receptable
- using moist sawdust is ideal
- they use 10 or so buckets in their system; storing 'used' buckets for 6 weeks at a time
- keep extra empty container buckets nearby
- need cover material nearby
- keep a clean layer of cover material on top
- when bucket is no longer in use, but is being stored, can add food compost as well before dumping entire thing to compost pile
- uses rainwater catchment system to rinse out buckets; dishsoap, scrubber
- shed covers compost and cover material to keep cover material dry; can also make a compost bin out of pallets
- composting urine is same process -- just add clean layer of cover material
