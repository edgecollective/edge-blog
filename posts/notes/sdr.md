from Dave S.:

here's a nice podcast called Foundations of Amateur Radio that consists of 5 min episodes.  Focused on getting started in the hobby and dealing with very practical topics and knowledge.  https://podcasts.vk6flab.com/podcasts/foundations

Very interesting is this project to develop a small Arduino-based SDR transceiver for HF modes (voice, digital, etc) here.:

Here's a schematic: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threeme3/QCX-SSB/master/ucx.png

from Mat L:

Check this stellar ham device. Its setup for low power and handling sensor inputs. http://picoaprs.de/index_en.html
