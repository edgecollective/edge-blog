Below is a development notebook for constructing a DIY CO2 monitor.

## CO2METER.COM K30

[Online description of K30](https://www.co2meter.com/products/k-30-co2-sensor-module)

[K30 Datasheet](http://co2meters.com/Documentation/Datasheets/DS_SE_0118_CM_0024_Revised9%20(1).pdf)

Needs 5V power minimum (actually, looks like it's best run at 6-9V); meanwhile, **Logic levels for the UART are at 3.3V**.

Useful info on logic levels / etc from the datasheet:

Meanwhile, though -- good advice on connecting to signals that run at higher voltage from JeeLab, [here](https://jeelabs.org/2010/12/16/voltage-3-3-vs-5/index.html).  Punchline -- can add a 1K resistor in series with signal as protection.

- 'G0' -- GND
- 'G+' -- Voltage input (5V to 9V)
- 'TxD, RxD' -- UART
- 'OUT1' -- Analog output (alternative way of getting the data)

Datasheet says: should avoid connecting analog and digital ground pins externally in order to avoid ground loops

## Connecting to an Arduino

### Via I2C

[Connecting a K30 to an Arduino via I2C](http://www.co2meters.com/Documentation/AppNotes/AN102-K30-Sensor-Arduino-I2C.pdf)

This suggests using 6 to 9V input. (Might be good to upgrade the spec on the MCP1702 voltage reg so we can take > 6V input on the Mothbot).  Needs to be able to provide 500mA.  So: direct from battery power is likely best.

### Via UART

Note: **Logic levels for the UART are at 3.3V**.

## <a name="gatewaysetup"></a> Remote LoRa CO2 Node and Heltec Gateway sending to FarmOS

Using a [Mothbot](https://edgecollective.io/posts/notes/mothbot/) to connect to the K30 sensor over UART and send via LoRa to a [Heltec](https://www.amazon.com/MakerFocus-Development-Bluetooth-0-96inch-Display/dp/B076MSLFC9) Wifi-LoRa gateway, posting to [FarmOS](https://edgecollective.farmos.net/farm/sensor/heltecone).

Code for remote and gateway is [here](https://github.com/edgecollective/co2-remote-and-gateway).

## Misc

Would be nice to develop useful ways of connecting to some standard hardware (e.g. Feathers, etc). 

## CO2 and Greenhouses 

[Article](https://www.greenhousegrower.com/production/monitoring-carbon-dioxide-in-the-greenhouse/) on measuring CO2 in greenhouses:

> Until recently, the vast majority of growers in the U.S. did not measure CO2 or use it to enrich their greenhouses. However, during the winter, CO2 levels can quickly become limiting in unventilated greenhouses full of plants on cold and sunny days. Over the past 10 years, we have also seen greenhouse growers seal up their greenhouses in an effort to control their heating bills during the winter. Other growers, especially in northern latitudes, have invested in supplemental lighting because of the numerous benefits, from improved quality and yields to reduced production time. An apparent result of tightly sealing the greenhouse is increased humidity and condensation. A not-so-apparent result of reducing air infiltration is a reduction of CO2 levels within the greenhouse below ambient levels found outdoors.
