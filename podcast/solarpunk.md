## Background

I'm a bit embarrassed to admit it, but I was once a dyed-in-the-wool techno-utopian.  Fully Automated Luxury Communism?  Solar-powered robots growing and preparing our food, so we all can simply relax and play and create?  I was once fully signed-up. 

But it was hard for me, even then, to ignore the dystopian possibilities of high technology;  science fiction is full of dark visions that seem inexorably to ooze across the porous barrier between fiction and reality.   I had grown up aspiring to be a scientist or technologist who helps lead us into a bright, thriving future;  the idea that I might instead be contributing to a future of exploitation and resource overshoot threatened to undermine the very foundation of my then-identity. 

I was therefore thrilled, back then, to discover the 'solarpunk' movement.  Solarpunks recognized the terrible potentials of emerging technologies for control and exploitation;  but they believed that many of these technologies could, if thoughtfully designed and deployed, bring great benefits to everyone.  They were committed to the possibility of a high-tech future in which everyone thrives.  As one popular [solarpunk manifesto](https://hieroglyph.asu.edu/2014/09/solarpunk-notes-toward-a-manifesto/) put it:

>> "Weâ€™re solarpunks because the only other options are denial or despair."

Solarpunk allowed me to retain my identity as a technologist, and still believe that I was contributing to a positive future. 

And then I read Chris Smaje.  And then Richard Heinberg.  I found the Doomer Optimism Podcast.  And through that podcast, Dougald.  Neurons migrated slowly ... then in droves ...

Fast forward to a few weeks ago.  It had been years since I'd thought of the solarpunk movement.  Rafi, and old friend from my solarpunk days, got back in touch.  He was organizing a solarpunk conference to be held in a few months.

Reconnecting with Rafi, I wondered: is there a core spirit in the 'solarpunk' movement that might survive energy descent, and the inevitable unraveling of high technology?  Is there a solarpunk without technology at its core?
 
I asked Rafi these questions in this conversation with Rafi.
