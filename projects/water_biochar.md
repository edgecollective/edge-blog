## Why decentralized water filtration?

Gaining access to clean drinking water is increasingly more difficult, around the world. Microbial contaminants, chlorination by-products, and pesticides are growing problems everywhere. 

Because chlorine helps to keep water safe from potentially harmful bacteria, water engineers typically design centralized water systems to [maintain a chlorine residual in the water that is distributed to households](https://mytapscore.com/blogs/tips-for-taps/disinfection-byproducts-the-adverse-effects-of-water-chlorination). This chlorine often interacts with organic matter in distribution pipes to produce some concentration of toxic chlorination by-products in the water delivered to homes; but this is typically viewed as an acceptable trade-off, as long as these concentrations are low. (The Florida Health Department has a [useful document on the regulation of trihalomethanes in drinking water](https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/drinking-water/_documents/thms-fs-2017.pdf)). 

Further: centralized water treatment infrastructure is dependent on a well-functioning electrical grid for its operation, the anticipated increasing frequency and severity of grid disruptions due to climate change will likely render centralized drinking water systems increasingly vulnerable to extended disruptions. 

For these reasons there has been a growing interest in developing solutions for clean drinking water at the local community or household level. 

<!--For example: the drinking water at Sipayik and Eastport [have apparently been contaminated with trihalomethanes](https://www.sunlightmediacollective.org/sipayik-drinking-water-crisis/) -- known carcinogens -- for decades. -->

## Why biochar?

One common technology for the removal of contaminants from water is the use of [activated carbon as a filter](https://www.awwa.org/portals/0/files/publications/documents/samples/activatedcarbonchap1.pdf).  As water passes through such a filter, contaminatns are adsorbed to the carbon in the filter and removed from the water. 

Such carbon filters only have a limited capacity for adbsoprtion, and therefore must be replaced after a certain amount of use.  Their cost is not trivial; so a household or small community using such filters for their drinking water will incur an ongoing cost.  Also, traditional methods for producing activated carbon typically rely on sophisticated industrial chemical processes and fossil fuel-based inputs.

Research in the last decade has indicated that biochar, when produced at sufficiently high temperatures, can serve in large part as a replacement for standard activated carbon filters.

Such biochar filters can be produced from a wide variety of biomass materials -- including common agricultural waste -- using equipment that can be manufactured locally from widely-available materials (some designs use two 55 gallon steel drums).

## How can we know whether the filter is effectively removing contaminants of concern?

A typical approach to testing the effectiveness of any filtering method is to conduct a laboratory test for the levels of contaminants of concern in the water before and after passing through the filter.

The challenge when working outside of academia, industry, or government is that such laboratory tests, even for a single contaminant, can be very costly -- on the order of $100 or more per sample.  Multiple tests to assess multiple contaminants, initial filter effectiveness, and ongoing filter effectiveness are therefore often infeasible.

Kearns et al have been working to develop lower-cost methods of testing that leverage a particular feature of biochar (and similar filters):  some contaminants adbsorb much more easily than others.  It turns out that the presence of one class of more weakly-adsorbed contaminants -- dissolved organic matter -- is relatively easy to assess with a lower-cost laboratory method:  UV spectrophotometry. 

The details of this approach are laid out in a 2020 article by Kearns et al:

- "Biochar Water Treatment for Control of Organic Micropollutants with UVA Surrogate Monitoring" -- [https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ees.2020.0173](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ees.2020.0173) | [PDF](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ees.2020.0173) | [local PDF](/img/biochar/kearns-et-al-2021-biochar-water-treatment-for-control-of-organic-micropollutants-with-uva-surrogate-monitoring.pdf)

And specific instructions for performing the UV absorbance test are laid out in the supplementary section, here:  

- "Supplementary data describing UV254 measurement": [docx](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/ees.2020.0173/suppl_file/Supp_Data.docx) | [pdf](/img/biochar/kearns_2021_uva_surrogate_supplement.pdf)

Further:  while commercial UV spectrophotometers used in such tests are usually over $2000, there are several designs available for DIY forms of the instrument, costing under $100 in parts.  We found one design to be particularly simple and well-characterized:

- "An accurate, precise, and affordable light emitting diode spectrophotometer for drinking water and other testing with limited resources" -- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988917/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988917/)

Our aim is to build a working prototype of this UV spectrophotometer, compare its performance to similar commercial instruments used in a laboratory, and then see if such an instrument might be easy to build and use in a community workshop setting.


## Well-documented designs for biochar-based water filtration systems

Dr. Josh Kearns (UNC) has led efforts in the last decade to assess the ability of biochar to filter out various water contaminants such as pesticides and chlorination by-products, and has developed designs that have now been built and used by communities around the world.  His team has produced manuals in several langauges for constructing water filtration systems. 

Kearns and his collaborators have formed a non-profit, [Aqueous Solutions](https://www.aqsolutions.org/), to disseminate their work.  Manuals, instructional videos, and peer-reviewed research are avaiable on their ["Charcoal / Biochar water treatment" page](https://www.aqsolutions.org/charcoal-biochar-water-treatment/).

Their designs include water filtration systems with capacities that range from small household use (300 liters or less) to larger-scale community use (2000 liters or more).

Manuals:

# Main questions

- How might we assess the performance of a given batch of biochar in an accessible way?
- Does UVA254 work to assess initial performance of a filter?
- Could we e.g. introduce some DOM into tap water, see that UVA254 is lower after biochar filter, and conclude that the filter is blocking DOM as well as more weakly-adsorbed micropollutants?
- Could we create some DOM-based 'standards' using distilled water and some easy-to-obtain substance, in order to assess a biochar filter and/or calibrate a DIY UVA254 instrument?

PFAS and activated carbon:

- PBS Wisconsin, ["What should I do about PFAS in my water?"](https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/what-should-i-do-about-pfas-in-my-water/)

> Granular activated carbon systems, generally the least expensive treatment option, can remove some PFAS, including PFOA and PFOS. They work by binding PFAS to a porous carbon surface. But molecularly shorter chemicals, known as short-chain PFAS, may slip by. You can install the filter as a household unit or in sinks, faucets, refrigerators and pitchers. Ion exchange resins act like little magnets that capture PFAS molecules. They are generally more effective than activated carbon, especially at snatching short-chain PFAS. Both technologies often cost less than reverse osmosis systems, which can run upwards of $1,000 to $2,000. Reverse osmosis devices force high-pressure water through a membrane with small pores to separate chemicals, including short-chain PFAS, from water. However, the technology requires a large volume of water, and it discharges PFAS-tainted backwash into sewer or septic systems — potentially reintroducing the contaminants into the environment.

- EPA, ["Reducing PFAS in Drinking Water with Treatment Technologies"](https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/reducing-pfas-drinking-water-treatment-technologies)
- EPA, ["Technologies for Reducing PFAS in Drinking Water"](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-10/documents/pfas_drinking_water_treatment_technology_options_fact_sheet_04182019.pdf)
- Riegel et al., ["Sorptive removal of short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) during drinking water treatment using activated carbon and anion exchanger"](https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-023-00716-5)

> Laboratory tests and column tests were carried out in a waterwoks to investigate the removal of short- and long-chain PFAS using activated carbon filtration and ion exchange treatment. For all adsorbents, the sorption affinity of short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) was significantly lower than that of long-chain PFAS or short-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA). In the PFAS-polluted groundwater matrix, the short-chain PFCA PFBA and PFPeA could only be sufficiently removed with activated carbon over short run times of 6000 and 11,000 bed volumes (BV), respectively. Longer PFCA with a chain length of C6 or more were removed over longer run times. The removal of short-chain PFCA using ion exchange media could also only be achieved over relatively short run times of 5000 BV for PFBA, 10,000BV for PFPeA and 18,000 BV for PFHxA. These are sometimes significantly longer than those of activated carbon. Due to the higher material costs for ion exchange media, there are nevertheless no lower operating costs when the ion exchangers are used in single-use mode. However, ion exchangers can be regenerated and then reused which can result in economic advantages compared to activated carbon filtration. However, for the extensive regeneration, especially for the elution of the long-chain PFAS, the additional use of ethanol is needed in the process. In contrast, the short-chain PFBA and PFPeA can be extracted without organic solvent from a weakly basic ion exchanger.

- Duke U. [article on at-home filter removal of PFAS](https://nicholas.duke.edu/news/not-all-home-drinking-water-filters-completely-remove-toxic-pfas#:~:text=Activated%2Dcarbon%20filters%20removed%2073,were%20not%20reduced%20at%20all.)

> Activated-carbon filters removed 73% of PFAS contaminants, on average, but results varied greatly. In some cases, the chemicals were completely removed; in other cases they were not reduced at all. Researchers saw no clear trends between removal efficiency and filter brand, age or source water chemical levels. Changing out filters regularly is probably a very good idea, nonetheless, researchers said.
