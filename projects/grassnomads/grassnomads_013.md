## Comparison, distance and temperature

### Comparing 'pre-upgrade' to 'post-upgrade' 

In the below charts, you can see how the distance measurements seem to be impacted.  

Note that in December, we were using the 'older' code.  The 'upgraded' code was used in January.

### Focus on 'post-upgrade'

Now we focus only on the 'upgraded' system.  Note that the system seems to register a greater distance when the temperatures are colder ... but that there doesn't seem to be a clear temperature threshold for this behavior.  

Perhaps here we are seeing a condensation effect that tends only to occur overnight?
