Below are some eclectic reading selections that provide a few entry points into the political economy groundings for "open science" movements: 

## Digital Colonialism and its Discontents

- Michael Kwet article on aljazeera.com, 13 Mar 2019:  ["Digital Colonialism is Threatening the Global South"](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/digital-colonialism-threatening-global-south-190129140828809.html).  

>> "Similar to the technical architecture of classic colonialism, digital colonialism is rooted in the design of the tech ecosystem for the purposes of profit and plunder. If the railways and maritime trade routes were the "open veins" of the Global South back then, today, digital infrastructure takes on the same role: Big Tech corporations use proprietary software, corporate clouds, and centralised Internet services to spy on users, process their data, and spit back manufactured services to subjects of their data fiefdoms." 

- Jaron Lanier interview in The Guardian's Science Weekly, 18 Mar 2013:  ["Who Owns the Future"](https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2013/mar/18/science-weekly-podcast-jaron-lanier).  

>> Lanier, originally a pioneering advocate of the 'open web', now reconsiders his initial vision.  He believes that the current technological landscape is 'too uneven to be open', with Big Tech and Big Finance able to 'out compute' the rest of us.  His proposal: that everyday people find ways of controlling their personal data so that large corporations can't mine it en masse. 

## Peer-to-Peer Networking and Local-First Software

- Ink and Switch position paper, April 2019: ["Local First Software"](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html). 

>> "Cloud apps like Google Docs and Trello are popular because they enable real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to access our work from all of our devices. However, by centralizing data storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data created with that software is lost."

>> "In this article we propose “local-first software”: a set of principles for software that enables both collaboration and ownership for users. Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy, long-term preservation, and user control of data."

- Digital Democracy position paper, Oct 29, 2019: ["Local-first software for frontline communities"](https://www.digital-democracy.org/blog/localfirst/)

>> "Cloud software simply doesn’t work where frontline communities live and where oil spills happen."

>> "Local-first means that data is stored on the device (laptop or mobile) first. When people are ready to share the data to another device, Mapeo synchronizes the data with the device of choice: laptop, phone, raspberry pi, home or even cloud infrastructure. The point here is consent over where the data is synchronized."

>> "We couple this with free and open source principles that bake in freedom and autonomy. This improves the conditions for agency, long-term preservation, and user control, and has the potential to shift the dominant paradigm of how technology is built. We are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in technology so that we can better stand in solidarity with marginalized communities."

- Paul Frazee presentation at JSCOnf, July 2018: ["Formalizing User Rights on the Web"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ffpAkviM0)

## Open Source Technology in Agriculture

- The website of the non-profit [FarmHack.org](https://farmhack.org/tools)

>> "We are a worldwide community of farmers that build and modify our own tools. We share our hacks online and at meet ups because we become better farmers when we work together."

- Aaron Orlowski, article posted on civileats.com on 12 Feb 2019: ["Open Source Technology Could Be a Boon to Farmers"](https://civileats.com/2019/12/02/open-source-technology-could-be-a-boon-to-farmers/)

>> "The growing ag tech sector can be pricey and ill-suited for smaller operations. These new companies aim to make it free, fair, and more accessible."

## The Solarpunk Movement

- Elvia Wilk article in e-flux architecture: ["Is Ornamenting Solar Panels a Crime?"](https://www.e-flux.com/architecture/positions/191258/is-ornamenting-solar-panels-a-crime/)

>> "By now, dystopia may have become a luxury genre. Indulging in miserable future scenarios is not something everyone has time for. William Gibson recently repurposed his own adage, “the future is here, it’s just not evenly distributed” to say that “dystopia is not very evenly distributed” either.2 For most, the dystopias the privileged entertain themselves with are old news. In the current political landscape, “when we are all living in the shadow of at least half a dozen wildly science fiction scenarios,” to quote Gibson again, and while Hollywood harps on every version of paranoia to construct a thousand dystopias according to formula, dwelling on dystopia could be seen as downright lazy.3 Along with the resources to sit around and ponder the future of humanity, shouldn’t there come the responsibility to invent actionable proposals as opposed to cautionary tales?"

- Adam Flynn position paper posted on hieroglyph.asu.edu, 4 Sept 2014: ["Solarpunk: Notes Towards a Manifesto"](https://hieroglyph.asu.edu/2014/09/solarpunk-notes-toward-a-manifesto/)

>> ""It’s hard out here for futurists under 30."

>> "As we percolated through our respective nations’ education systems, we were exposed to WorldChanging and TED talks, to artfully-designed green consumerism and sustainable development NGOs. Yet we also grew up with doomsday predictions slated to hit before our expected retirement ages, with the slow but inexorable militarization of metropolitan police departments, with the failure of the existing political order to deal with the existential-but-not-yet-urgent threat of climate change. Many of us feel it’s unethical to bring children into a world like ours. We have grown up under a shadow, and if we sometimes resemble fungus it should be taken as a credit to our adaptability."

>> "We’re solarpunks because the only other options are denial or despair."

- Ben Valentine and Vincent Callebaut, article on hopesandfears.com: ["Solarpunk Wants to Save the World"](http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/city/life/215749-solarpunk)

>> "The "solar" in Solarpunk is both a description and metaphor for the movement's commitment to a utopia that is accessible to every human on earth, as well as to all of our planet's lifeforms. No single business can capture and privatize sunlight to hoard it for itself or sell it at a cost. It's one of the only universally accessible goods. Solarpunk futures envision a world of distributed clean energy, available and benefiting everyone."

>> "The re-distribution of power, whether it's political or electric, is at the heart of my story," Solarpunk author, Alia Gee, tells Hopes&Fears. 'Getting the power aspect taken care of is the only way I believe there can be a better future for everyone. (I'm very keen on the everyone part. Not just white males or CIS or human-like life forms.)'"

## Salvagepunk

- Zak Bronson, LA Review of Books, review of China Mieville's *Railsea* (2013), posted 12 Feb 2016: ["Living in the Wreckage"](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/living-in-the-wreckage)

>> "Avoiding any straightforward revival of hopeful optimism, Miéville’s essay provides a challenging discussion of deep problems facing the planet; in particular, it focuses on the fundamental incompatibility between environmental justice and the demands of capitalist accumulation. Countering the once-hopeful claim that climate change would unite rich and poor alike, Miéville notes that dreams of better worlds have become the fantasies of corporate newspeak. “Utopias are necessary,” he writes, “but not only are they insufficient: they can, in some iterations, be part of the ideology of the system, the bad totality that organises us, warms the skies, and condemns millions to peonage on garbage scree.” Exploring a range of problems — from a trash incinerator installed in the poorest district of Los Angeles to UN-backed plans to evict citizens from their land — Miéville portrays an increasingly polarized world where dreams of bright futures are often purchased at the expense of the world’s most disenfranchised. Miéville forces readers to question where they put their faith: what we need, in his view, is more rage at the false hope offered to us through the fractured lens of corporate solutionism. In what might be considered a slogan for the journal’s mix of optimism and indignation, Miéville writes that “[w]e need utopia, but to try to think utopia, in this world, without rage, without fury, is an indulgence we can’t afford […] we cannot think utopia without hate.”

## Ecosocialism 

- 170 Dutch academics, posted recently: ["Five Proposals for a Better World After the Pandemic"](https://climateandcapitalism.com/2020/04/20/five-proposals-for-a-better-world-after-the-pandemic/)

>> "While some short-term positive social and environmental impacts have emerged in the crisis — such as community support, local organizing and solidarity, less pollution and GHG emissions — these changes will be temporary and marginalized without concerted efforts for broader political and economic change. It is therefore necessary to envision how this current situation could lead to a more sustainable, fair, equitable, healthy, and resilient form of (economic) development going forward; one that acknowledges the structurally unsound pressures of the neoliberal model on people and environments, and that establishes policies and political strategies to achieve meaningful, sustainable and equitable change."
