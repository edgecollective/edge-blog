# Reducing the risk of indoor COVID-19 transmission

We know that COVID-19 is airborne (REFS), and that virus-laden airborne particles, exhaled by infected individuals, can flow like cigarette smoke, indoors.

This means that transmission is greatest among individuals who are in closest proximity; but that it is still possible to transmit the disease at a significant distance -- i.e., across a room.  

A fairly good mental model is to think of the virus-laden particles exhaled by an infected individual in a typical room as building up over time like the exhalations of a cigarette smoker.  If there is poor ventilation in the room, it is more likely for others in the room, or who enter the room later, to inhale some of these particles, and become infected. 

The best way to mitigate COVID transmission risk is therefore to be outdoors; but we often need to interact indoors.  

Three basic methods are used to reduce the amount of indoor viral exposure:

- **Wearing masks**: good masks, worn properly, can protect both the wearer and those around them; 
- **Air purifiers** can be used to remove viral-laden particles from indoor air, typically recycling the 'cleaned' air back into the space, using some sort of filter-based technology (such as HEPA or MERV-13 filtration systems);
- **Improving indoor ventilation** by increasing indoor-outdoor air exhchange rates:  typically, by opening windows and doors, or via the HVAC system.

The first method -- mask wearing -- has been covered extensively elsewhere. As for the second method -- air purification -- we cover some inexpensive, DIY approaches to indoor air purification in [this post](/airbox).  


The main way to improving indoor ventilation is to increase the rate at which indoor air, which may contain the exhaled viral particles of infected individuals, is replaced by 'clean' air -- air that has either been recycled indoors through filtration systems, or brought into the room from outside. 

Because 'bare virus' itself is difficult or expensive to detect, we assess whether these systems work typically by using 'tracers'.

In the case of filtration systems, some detectable particulate matter of the sizes that might carry viral partciles can be used as a 'tracer', in conjuction with particulate matters sensors, to estimate the effectiveness of the filters.

In the case of indoor-outdoor air exchange rates, CO2 and can be used as a 'tracer gas' by injecting an amount of CO2 into the room and using CO2 monitors to measure the rate at which this 'excess CO2' decays -- this will be related to the 'air changes per hour' (ACH) in the room.

### Ventilation


## How can we minimize the risk of indoor COVID-19 transmission?

### 1. Wear a mask



### 2. Improve indoor ventilation

Another basic way is to reduce the potential amount of viral particles floating in the air -- either by:  

**Replacing indoor air (which may contain virus-laden particles) with outdoor air as rapidly as possible**.

**Removing virus from indoor air using air purifiers**.

# Assessing Indoor Ventilation

## Air changes per hour (ACH)

A basic measure of indoor ventilation is "ACH", or air changes per hour.  To minimize COVID risk, we generally want the highest ACH we can manage.  

(Some notes on ACH levels)

# Improving Indoor Ventilation

Some example of ways to improve indoor ventilation are:
- open windows and doors
- set HVAC system to increase the amount of outdoor air exchange
- use air purifiers
- limit the number of people indoors at any one time, and allow sufficient time between occupancies of different groups

You can also make your own DIY air purifiers for relatively lower cost -- see the ["Airbox"](/airbox) presentation on this site.
