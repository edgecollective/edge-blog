# Reducing the risk of indoor COVID-19 transmission

(A good general reference for this topic, in the context of school classrooms, is a recent guide by the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health: ["Risk Reduction Strategies for Reopening Schools"](https://schools.forhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2020/06/Harvard-Healthy-Buildings-Program-Schools-For-Health-Reopening-Covid19-June2020.pdf) Note, however, that some of the guidance in that document seems to pre-date the recognition of COVID-19 as spread primarily through airborne transmission.)

We know that COVID-19 is airborne (REFS), and that virus-laden airborne particles, exhaled by infected individuals, can flow like cigarette smoke, indoors.

This means that transmission is greatest among individuals who are in closest proximity; but that it is still possible to transmit the disease at a significant distance -- i.e., across a room.  

A fairly good mental model is to think of the virus-laden particles exhaled by an infected individual in a typical room as building up over time like the exhalations of a cigarette smoker.  If there is poor ventilation in the room, it is more likely for others in the room, or who enter the room later, to inhale some of these particles, and become infected. 

The best way to mitigate COVID transmission risk is therefore to be outdoors; but we often need to interact indoors.  

Three basic methods are used to reduce the amount of indoor viral exposure:

- **Wearing masks**: good masks, worn properly, can protect both the wearer and those around them; 
- **Air purifiers** can be used to remove viral-laden particles from indoor air, typically recycling the 'cleaned' air back into the space, using some sort of filter-based technology (such as HEPA or MERV-13 filtration systems);
- **Improving indoor ventilation** by increasing indoor-outdoor air exhchange rates:  typically, by opening windows and doors, or via the HVAC system.

The first method -- mask wearing -- has been covered extensively elsewhere. As for the second method -- air purification -- we cover some inexpensive, DIY approaches to indoor air purification in [this post](/airbox).  

The main way to improving indoor ventilation is to increase the rate at which indoor air, which may contain the exhaled viral particles of infected individuals, is replaced by 'clean' air -- air that has either been recycled indoors through filtration systems, or brought into the room from outside. 

Because 'bare virus' itself is difficult or expensive to detect, we assess whether these systems work typically by using 'tracers'.

In the case of filtration systems, some detectable particulate matter of the sizes that might carry viral partciles can be used as a 'tracer', in conjuction with particulate matters sensors, to estimate the effectiveness of the filters.

In the case of indoor-outdoor air exchange rates, CO2 and can be used as a 'tracer gas' by injecting an amount of CO2 into the room and using CO2 monitors to measure the rate at which this 'excess CO2' decays -- this will be related to the 'air changes per hour' (ACH) in the room, a common measure of indoor ventilation rate.

## Assessing indoor ventilation through the 'CO2 steady state' method

> In between commissioning events, there are several ways to test whether a classroom’s ventilation
delivers sufficient outdoor air. In addition to working with trained experts, a school could quickly evaluate
ventilation performance using carbon dioxide (CO2
) as a proxy for ventilation using low-cost indoor air
quality monitors. In an unoccupied classroom, background CO2
 would be approximately equal to the
concentration of CO2
 in the atmosphere: 410 ppm. When students and teachers are present in a classroom,
they exhale CO2
 into classroom air at a relatively constant rate causing CO2
 to rise above the background
concentration. At some point, the concentration of CO2
 reaches an equilibrium based on the amount
generated indoors, and the amount diluted by ventilation. This is called ‘steady-state’ and can be used as
a quick indicator of ventilation performance. If the measured CO2
 concentrations while students are present
are mostly below 1,000 ppm, then the outdoor air ventilation is likely reaching acceptable minimums.
Lower CO2
 concentrations while students are present mean there is acceptable outdoor air ventilation rates;
higher CO2
 concentrations suggest other strategies for increasing outdoor air ventilation are needed.
It is important to note that CO2
 measurements are only useful when a full class of students is present;
otherwise, ventilation will be overestimated. Also, while CO2
 measurements are a good indicator of overall
ventilation, they will not indicate whether other air cleaning interventions are effective. For example, if a
classroom is operating portable air cleaners to remove the virus from air, viruses and other pollutants will be
removed even if CO2
 remains high because cleaners with HEPA filters are not designed to remove CO2
.
