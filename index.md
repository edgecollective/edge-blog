<h1> Edge Collective </h1>

> Climate-adaptive infrastructure for communities living at â€˜the edge' -- including rural and off-grid farms, urban areas vulnerable to flooding, and island communities.

<h2> Who we are ... </h2>

We're a distributed R&D, teaching, and training cooperative working to help individuals and communities increase the capacity of their vital <b>food, water, energy, and communications infrastructure</b> to adapt to changing environmental conditions. 

More broadly, our work aims to enhance **local technological sovereignty** (autonomy, control) while also promoting **global technological solidarity** (collaboration, mutual aid).  

<h2> What we do ...</h2>

We work to accomplish our mission by:


- Developing <b>free and open source</b> designs -- software, hardware, mechanical
- **Retro-fitting** / repairing / enhancing existing infrastructure 
- Offering **workshops**, teaching and training (videos, online documentation, remote or in-person meet-ups)



<p> Recently we've been focused on:</p> 

- **Off-grid farming** -- monitoring soil moisture, greenhouse temperature)
- **Flood mitigation** -- designing flood alert systems for coastal or urban municipalities (sent via email / sms / satellite modem);
- **Water quality** -- salinity monitoring to mitigate saltwater contamination of freshwater sources, and to support oceanographic research;
- **Conservation ecology** -- assessing the impact of climate change on various vulnerable species (e.g. diamond back terrapins)

<h2> Designs, Projects, Workshops, Software, Hardware ... </h2>

You can find all of our code and hardware designs online [here](https://github.com/edgecollective). (Not all of it is very well-documented -- sorry, we're working on it :))


<h2>Let's Work Together!</h2>

We are dedicated to creating opportunities for developing and sharing useful knowledge & helping others to do the same. We'd love to hear from you!
