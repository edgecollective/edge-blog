<h2> Who we are ... </h2>

We're a distributed R&D, teaching, and training cooperative working to help individuals and communities increase the capacity of their vital <b>food, water, energy, and communications infrastructure</b> to adapt to changing environmental conditions. 

We share a dedication to increasing **local sovereignty** (autonomy, control) while also promoting **global solidarity** (collaboration, mutual aid).  

<h2> What we do ...</h2>

We work to accomplish our mission by:

<ul>
        <li>Developing free, open designs -- software, hardware, mechanical</li>
        <li>Retro-fitting / repairing / enhancing existing infrastructure </li>
        <li>Offering workshops, teaching and training (videos, online documentation, remote or in-person meet-ups)</li>

</ul>

<p> Recently we've been focused on:</p> 

<ul>
	<li>Off-grid farming -- monitoring soil moisture, greenhouse temperature)</li>
	<li>Flood mitigation -- designing flood alert systems for coastal or urban municipalities (sent via email / sms / satellite modem);</li>
	<li>Water quality -- salinity monitoring to mitigate saltwater contamination of freshwater sources, and to support oceanographic research;</li>
  <li>Conservation ecology -- assessing the impact of climate change on various vulnerable species (e.g. diamond back terrapins)</li>
</ul>

<h2> Designs, Projects, Workshops, Software, Hardware ... </h2>

You can find all of our code and hardware designs online [here](https://github.com/edgecollective). (Not all of it is very well-documented -- sorry, we're working on it :))


<h2>Let's Work Together!</h2>

We are dedicated to creating opportunities for developing and sharing useful knowledge & helping others to do the same. We'd love to hear from you!
