# Background

Design requirements:

- Accommodate some typical crate sizes, e.g. [24" x 20" x 11"](https://www.uline.com/Product/Detail/S-24138G/Stack-and-Nest-Containers/Ventilated-Stack-and-Nest-Container-24-x-20-x-11-Green) and [23" x 7" x 15" Nursery Crate](https://caribbeangardenseed.com/products/stackable-black-plastic-nursery-crate-1crate-great-for-harvesting-vegetables);
- Allow for 2 x 2 or 2 x 4 stacking of crates;
- Wheel base should straddle 30" beds
- Use recycled bicycle wheels
- Improve on use of [Vermont Cart](https://cartsvermont.com/product-category/garden-carts/):

# Initial Design

| ![](/img/cratecart/cart_side_top.png) |
|:--:|
| Carrying area of planned 'crate cart' is 44" x 54". |

Design notes / ideas:
- Because cart will be lighter-weight than Vermont cart, and wheel must be mounted further forward, consider shifting 'back bumper' forward so that center of rear-placed crate is over wheel center
- Accommodate different recycled wheel widths by using a 'brace' and shifting two halves of frame with respect to eachother within the brace
