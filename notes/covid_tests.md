# Overview 

It's customary to distinguish two aspects of a COVID test's performance:
- its **sensitivity**: how frequently it correctly detects the presence of the virus (test is 'positive' when virus is present)  
- its **specificity**: how frequently it correctly detects the absence of the virus (test is 'negative' when the virus is absent)

(For further explanation of these concepts, see: [https://questdirect.questdiagnostics.com/myquest-faq1/QuestDirect/COVID_1077.htm](https://questdirect.questdiagnostics.com/myquest-faq1/QuestDirect/COVID_1077.htm) )

The relative importance of sensitivity and specificity varies depending on the application and the audience for the test:

- From a **public health** or **practitioner** standpoint, it's desirable to have a test that is both highly sensitive and highly specific. Low sensitivity ('frequent false negatives') means one misses many cases where the virus is present, leading to increased transmission risk; low specificity ('many false positives') means one incorrectly identifies individuals as positive, leading to unnecessary burden on the healthcare system, unnecessary absences from school or work, etc. 

- From a **individual risk** standpoint, a test which is highly specific test may still be very useful, even if it isn't very sensitive.  I.e.: if a negative test is very likely to indicate a true 'negative', one can simply postpone a social engagement on this basis, and test again when convenient.    

# RT-LAMP

The most accurate overall testing technology currently is 'molecular'. 'PCR' is a type of molecular test, as is 'LAMP'.  (For more details on this, see [https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/04/1024450/at-home-covid-test-review-accuracy-binaxnow-lucira-ellume/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/04/1024450/at-home-covid-test-review-accuracy-binaxnow-lucira-ellume/).

LAMP tests can be performed at home, and seem to be as specific as PCR.  See: [https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2022/01/lamp-testing-accuracy.page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2022/01/lamp-testing-accuracy.page)
