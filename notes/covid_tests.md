Performing a test can give two types of answers:  'positive' (suggesting the presence of the disease) or 'negative' (suggesting the absence of the disease).

It's customary to distinguish two aspects of a test's performance:
- its *sensitivity*: how frequently it correctly detects the presence of the virus (test is 'positive' when virus is present)  
- its *specificity*: how frequently it correctly detects the absence of the virus (test is 'negative' when the virus is absent)

For further explanation, this reference seemed useful: [https://questdirect.questdiagnostics.com/myquest-faq1/QuestDirect/COVID_1077.htm](https://questdirect.questdiagnostics.com/myquest-faq1/QuestDirect/COVID_1077.htm)

From a public health or practitioner standpoint, one would like both of these characteristics to be as high as possible. Low sensitivity ('false negatives') means one misses many cases where the virus is present, leading to increased transmission risk; low specificity ('false positives') means one incorrectly identifies individuals as positive, leading to unnecessary burden on the healthcare system, unnecessary absences from school or work, etc. 

From a individual risk standpoint, it seems possible to tolerate a highly specific test even if it isn't as sensitive.  I.e., if a negative test is very likely to indicate a true 'negative', one can simply postpone a social engagement on this basis, and test again when convenient.    

## RT-LAMP

The most accurate overall testing technology currently is 'molecular'. 'PCR' is a type of molecular test, as is 'LAMP'.  (For more details on this, see [https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/04/1024450/at-home-covid-test-review-accuracy-binaxnow-lucira-ellume/](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/05/04/1024450/at-home-covid-test-review-accuracy-binaxnow-lucira-ellume/).

LAMP tests can be performed at home, and seem to be as specific as PCR.  See: [https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2022/01/lamp-testing-accuracy.page](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2022/01/lamp-testing-accuracy.page)
