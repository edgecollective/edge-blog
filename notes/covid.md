alternative small world network definition idea, more tractable analytically:
[https://d-nb.info/1194507883/34](https://d-nb.info/1194507883/34)

epidemic dynamics on an adaptive network [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16803215/#:~:text=Here%20we%20study%20epidemic%20dynamics,hysteresis%2C%20and%20first%20order%20transitions.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16803215/#:~:text=Here%20we%20study%20epidemic%20dynamics,hysteresis%2C%20and%20first%20order%20transitions.) -- nice follow-up articles listed -- and, pdf is here: [https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.208701](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.208701) -- neat!

Note: they're optimizing for efficiency ... but interesting to wonder if there is a tradeoff in efficiency vs resilience ...

resilience, p 458

"Modeling topologically resilient supply chain networks" ![](/img/covid/supply_chain_resilience.png), via [https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-018-0070-7](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-018-0070-7)

Interesting -- above paper is really about trying to generate network models based on observed real-world networks via some learning algorithm ...

"Network science approach to modelling the topology and robustness of supply chain networks: a review and perspective" [https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0053-0](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-017-0053-0) -- ah, looks like a great review & perspective 

Ah, interesting -- figure out what properties of a real-world network are sort of 'trivial', shared by all networks of that type, and which are unusual: ![](/img/covid/determining_unique_properties.png)

Robustness vs resilience ![](/img/covid/robustness_vs_resilience.png)

Barabasi's network science book online: [http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/1](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/1)

"A supply chain view of the resilience enterprise" [https://www.proquest.com/openview/ab02ef85c43466ea1085994bc7340615/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=26142](https://www.proquest.com/openview/ab02ef85c43466ea1085994bc7340615/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=26142)

"Node-Level Resilience Loss in Dynamic Complex Networks" [https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Network-Rewiring-Unwiring-to-Change-Resilience-i-a-parent-networks-node-11-has_fig6_339536011](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Network-Rewiring-Unwiring-to-Change-Resilience-i-a-parent-networks-node-11-has_fig6_339536011)

> "In an increasingly connected world, the resilience of networked dynamical systems is important in
the felds of ecology, economics, critical infrastructures, and organizational behaviour. Whilst we
understand small-scale resilience well, our understanding of large-scale networked resilience is
limited. Recent research in predicting the efective network-level resilience pattern has advanced our
understanding of the coupling relationship between topology and dynamics. However, a method to
estimate the resilience of an individual node within an arbitrarily large complex network governed
by non-linear dynamics is still lacking. Here, we develop a sequential mean-feld approach and show
that after 1-3 steps of estimation, the node-level resilience function can be represented with up to
98% accuracy. This new understanding compresses the higher dimensional relationship into a onedimensional dynamic for tractable understanding, mapping the relationship between local dynamics
and the statistical properties of network topology. By applying this framework to case studies in
ecology and biology, we are able to not only understand the general resilience pattern of the network,
but also identify the nodes at the greatest risk of failure and predict the impact of perturbations. These
fndings not only shed new light on the causes of resilience loss from cascade efects in networked
systems, but the identifcation capability could also be used to prioritize protection, quantify risk, and
inform the design of new system architectures."

-- yes, this is the concept I was looking for!  'pinning control'

looks like 'resilience and rewiring' are good key words to search for here [https://www.google.com/search?q=network+resilience+rewiring+function&oq=network+resilience+rewiring+function&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.5997j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=network+resilience+rewiring+function&oq=network+resilience+rewiring+function&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.5997j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)

> In the current work, an ideal setting was proposed
where non-infected nodes were assumed to behave rationally and have perfect knowledge of the disease status
of their current neighbors and potential new neighbors.
It would be of interest to consider a situation in which
not all contagious individuals appear ill or know that
they are contagious, as might be the case for a sexually transmitted disease possessing asymptomatic individuals.. This effect might be modeled by simultaneous
spreading through the network of both the disease and
information about the disease. If the current model is extended with information and community structure, social
dynamics could be extrapolated to improve contact tracing and epidemic control in organized populations with
local structure.
