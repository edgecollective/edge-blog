blurb: Low-power devices that can mutually geo-locate off-grid.

## Overview

Many people rely on smartphones for navigation and communication; but what happens if the cell network is unavailable?  

Even if local cell service is unavailable, GPS satellite navigation likely is; and there are low-power radio alternatives that are able to broadcast several kilometers, line-of-sight (and perhaps further, via mesh). 

Our aim here is to prototype devices that can a) locate their position via GPS; b) report that position to another device via GPS; and c) provide this information in some simple visual way (for example, as an arrow pointing in the direction of the other device, with an estimated distance to the other device).

## Applications


**'Dog compass'**.
