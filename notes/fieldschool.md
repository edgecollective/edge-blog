# Background

We're beginning to sketch out an informal 'field school' curriculum, intended for both adults and kids, and focused on skills and projects relevant to climate adaptation, local food production, and community resilience.  

The working thesis behind this project is that the development of skills relevant to a lower-energy, 'post-carbon' world -- e.g., learning to grow, prepare, and preserve food; salvaging, repairing, and repurposing old equipment; building DIY musical instruments -- is also simply 'good pedagogy', regardless of what the future holds. 

# Topics

A preliminary list of possible topics around which to develop workshops and collaborations is below. 

## Food
- Food preservation
- Mini underground cold storage

- Seed starting

## Shelter
- Yurt
- Treehouse
- Trailer-based 
- Tarps
- Tents

- Platform

- Hot tub

## Water
- Drip irrigation
- Rain barrel collection (expand to tarp-fed, greenhouse-fed)
- Small pond / reservoir

## Energy

- Energy estimates and arithmetic 

## Communications
- Radio

## Navigation
- Off-grid GPS
