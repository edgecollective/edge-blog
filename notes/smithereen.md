# Inkbird temp controller 

The [Inkbird ITC-308 temp controller](https://inkbird.com/products/temperature-controller-itc-308) (which, as of 4/26/23, can be purchased for [$35 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HXM5UAC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1)) is a sort of 'thermostat' that allows the user to program temperature thresholds that will trigger a fan or a heater to turn on or off.

A brief explanation of how it works is in the video below:
